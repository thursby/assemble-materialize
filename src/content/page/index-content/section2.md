What is it good for?
-----------------------------

Absolutely some things. Not every site makes sense as a static site. Some
sites have requirements that can only be met by dynamic content management 
systems. 

A static site like this one doesn't have the overhead of a CMS, so it can be
hosted practically anywhere. As an added bonus static sites are much faster than dynamic sites because they don't include the overhead of databases and runtimes.

Some great use cases for a static site are:

- Brochure site
- Marking landing page
- Promotional site
- Movie or video game launch
