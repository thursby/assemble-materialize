What is it good for?
-----------------------------

Absolutely some things. Not every site makes sense as a static site. Some
sites have requirements that can only be met by dynamic content management 
systems. 

A static site like this one doesn't have the overhead of a CMS, so it can be
hosted practically anywhere. Plus, without the overhead of database queries and
executing dynamic code, static sites are much faster than dynamic sites.

Some great use cases for a static site are:

- Brochure site
- Marking landing page
- Promotional site
- Movie or video game launch
