What is this?
--------------------------

It's a website template.

Specifically, it's a starter template to help create a modern,
full featured website, but in a way that is simultaneously fast, cheap, and easy.

Using Grunt and Assemble.io, the Materialize framework may be used to build
beautiful interfaces that are simple to maintain and so simple they may be
hosted practically anywhere, for cheap or even free in a lot of cases.

This template's aim is to make these two technologies easy to use together.
