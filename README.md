What is assemble-materialize?
--------------------------

It's a website.

Specifically, it's a starter template to help create a modern,
full featured website, but in a way that is simultaneously fast, cheap, and easy.

Using Grunt and Assemble.io, the Materialize framework may be used to build
beautiful interfaces that are simple to maintain and so simple they may be
hosted practically anywhere, for cheap or even free in a lot of cases.

This template's aim is to make these two technologies easy to use together.

What is it good for?
-----------------------------

Absolutely some things. Not every site makes sense as a static site. Some
sites have requirements that can only be met by dynamic content management 
systems. 

A static site like this one doesn't have the overhead of a CMS, so it can be
hosted practically anywhere. Plus, without the overhead of database queries and
executing dynamic code, static sites are much faster than dynamic sites.

Some great use cases for a static site are:

- Brochure site
- Marking landing page
- Promotional site
- Movie or video game launch

Why would anyone do that?
-------------------

As long as it meets requirements, a static site will be cheaper to build,
cheaper to run, and cheaper to maintain. All of this without sacrificing 
performance.

In fact, static sites can use cutting edge technology like 
[Netlify](http://www.netlify.com) as a host. Services like Netlify host static 
sites on their custom built CDN in multiple locations around the planet.
